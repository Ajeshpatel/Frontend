    <h1><i>The Minimalist Web</i>: Crafting Pages with Only the Basics</h1>
    <p><small>By <b>Alex Parker</b> | Published: August 15, 2025</small></p>
    <p>In a world where websites are loaded with flashy animations, heavy scripts, and high-resolution images, the art of
    building a <i>pure, lightweight</i> webpage is nearly forgotten. This article explores the charm and power of HTML’s <mark>simplesttags.</mark>
    <hr>

    <h2>The Back-to-Basics Movement</h2>
    <p>Back in the early days of the internet, webpages were nothing more than plain text, sprinkled with <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i>
    styles. The focus was on the <strong>content,</strong> not the decoration. In many ways, this was the <i>golden age</i> of readability.</p>
    </p>
    <p>The <u>HTML</u> language itself was designed for structure — headings, paragraphs, and semantic meaning. E = mc<sup>2</sup> still looks
    good without a single pixel of CSS, and H<sub>2</sub>O remains as clear as ever.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Strip It Down?</h2>
    <p>There’s a quiet beauty in simplicity. Without distractions, readers focus on the words. Minimalism is not the lack of
    something, it’s the perfect amount of something, as a famous designer once said.</p>
    <p>Removing images and heavy layouts means faster load times, better accessibility, and even nostalgia for the <del>chaotic</del>
    <u>simpler</u> internet days.</p>

    <h2>Magazine-Style Sections</h2>
    <p>Just like in a printed magazine, articles can be divided with <u>Bold headings</u> and subtle separators. Think of
    &lt;hr&gt; as the thin line between chapters, and headings as your section titles.</p>
    <p>You can even keep a “side note” feel with smaller text for author comments or additional reading hints.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>A Practical Demonstration</h2>
    <p>Imagine we are describing a recipe in this minimal style:</p>
    <p>Step 1: Mix 250<sub>g</sub> of flour with H<sub>2</sub>O until smooth. Step 2: Heat at 180°C for 30 minutes. Step 3: <strike>Serve cold</strike> <u> Serve warm</u> for
    best taste.</p>
    <p>Code snippet: temperature = 180; // degrees Celsius</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>The Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>Stripping a webpage down to its <em>bare essentials</em> is not just a design choice — it’s a statement. It says: The words
    matter more than the wrapping.</p>
    <p>So the next time you open a code editor, try creating a page with nothing but <i>headings, paragraphs, and text formatting.</i>
    You might just rediscover the timeless elegance of the early web.
